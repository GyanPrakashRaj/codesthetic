# Contribution guidelines

First of all, thanks for thinking of contributing to this project. :smile:

Before sending a Pull Request, please make sure that you're assigned the task on a GitHub issue.

- If a relevant issue already exists, discuss on the issue and get it assigned to yourself on GitHub.
- If no relevant issue exists, open a new issue and get it assigned to yourself on GitHub.

Please proceed with a Pull Request only after you're assigned. It'd be sad if your Pull Request (and your hardwork) isn't accepted just because it isn't ideologically compatible.

# Developing the codesthetic

1. Install

2. Make your changes in a different git branch (say, `add-new-flag`).
3. (Optional) To test whether `json` executable is working properly.

4. (Required for YAML file changes) These are the specifications for the YAML files -

    - `files.yaml`, `folders.yaml` : The keys are sorted alphabetically.
    - `file_aliases.yaml`, `folder_aliases.yaml` : The values are sorted alphabetically. For each set of keys mapping to a value, those set of keys are also sorted alphabetically.

5. Check before pushing.
